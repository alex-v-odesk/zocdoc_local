The study finds 30 percent of women have told a little white lie or omitted information to their doctor, compared to 23 percent of men, who are more forthcoming and open about their well-being.\r\n\r\nThe trust barrier for both men and women is fueled by embarrassment and too little face time with doctors. Nearly half (46%) of Americans have avoided telling their doctor about a health issue because they were embarrassed or afraid of being judged. Around a third say they withheld details because they couldn’t find the right opportunity or didn’t have enough time during the appointment (27%) or because the doctor didn’t ask any questions or specifically if anything was bothering them (32%).\r\n\r\n“As doctors, we expect some patients will withhold information in the exam room. There is a lot of emotion around personal health. But I think many doctors would be surprised to hear they’re getting half-stories often because they haven’t left enough time to ask,” said ZocDoc founder and president Dr. Oliver Kharraz.\r\n\r\nIn addition to confiding in their doctor, patients are turning to resources close to home.\r\n<blockquote>• <b>Putting trust in the “family doctor”:</b> When feeling unwell, nearly half (47%) of Americans turn to loved ones for advice, telling an immediate family member or significant other about their symptoms. For couples, significant others become a trusted caretaker, particularly for men who are 22 percent more likely than women to turn to a partner first with health concerns (32% vs. 25%). Mom or Dad is the first phone call for more than one-third (36%) of millennials.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>• <b>More honest with casual confiders:</b> When it comes to discussing bad health habits, people are sometimes more comfortable talking with professionals in casual settings like the gym or hair salon. Nearly twice as many women than men (18% vs. 11%) would confess their bad health behaviors to someone like a manicurist or hairstylist over a doctor. This rings even more true among millennials, who are 45 percent more likely than their older counterparts (22% vs. 12%) to confide in a trusted beauty or fitness professional over a doctor.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>• <b>When a doctor’s opinion becomes more important:</b> The patient-doctor relationship gets better with age. Thirty-nine percent of 35-44-year-olds go to a doctor first when not feeling well; this increases to 45 percent for the 45-64 cohort and 58 percent for those 65 and older. However, white lies persist – but for different reasons. Sixty-four percent of Americans 65 and older have avoided bringing up an issue with their doctor because they didn’t think it was that serious or worth discussing (vs. 49% of 18-64-year-olds).</blockquote>\r\n“In this survey, patients give us hints about how we can better foster trust,” said Kharraz. “Doctors can create more opportunities to share information – giving patients the space to reveal their concerns in the exam room or even before the appointment with check-in forms. And patients can take steps to find the right doctor for their needs by reviewing online profiles and other patient reviews.”\r\n\r\nZocDoc’s free service makes finding the right doctor easy. Patients can search profiles of in-network, neighborhood doctors and see what other real patients have to say, before booking an appointment. They can fill out their paperwork online, so that there’s more time in the exam room to discuss concerns, and receive reminders for upcoming appointments and preventive check-ups to help create a regular cadence of personal health discussions with their doctor.\r\n\r\nFind out more about ZocDoc’s survey and view the infographic <a href="http://blog.zocdoc.com/healthcares-open-secret-white-lies-in-the-exam-room/">here</a>.\r\n\r\n<b>About the Study</b>\r\nThe ZocDoc Survey was conducted by Kelton Global among nationally representative Americans ages 18 and over using an e-mail invitation and an online survey. Survey questions were fielded in two parts:\r\n<blockquote>• May 13 - 26, 2015 to 2,183 nationally representative respondents. The margin of error for this study is +/- 2.1 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level\r\n\r\n• September 22 – September 28, 2015 to 1,021 nationally representative respondents. The margin of error for this study is +/- 3.1 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level\r\nPlease note the margin of error for any subgroups will be slightly higher.</blockquote>\r\n<b><u>About ZocDoc</u></b>\r\nZocDoc is the tech company at the beginning of a better healthcare experience.

Powered by national digital health marketplace <a href="http://www.zocdoc.com">ZocDoc</a>, UH is the first hospital system to offer real-time online booking to Ohio patients.\r\n\r\nUH’s collaboration with ZocDoc enhances patients’ ability to more conveniently find and schedule appointments with doctors any time of day, even when the office is closed. Forty percent of appointments scheduled via ZocDoc are booked outside of typical business hours.\r\n\r\n“This service brings great value and convenience to patients,” said University Hospitals CEO Thomas F. Zenty III. “Patients, as consumers, deserve and expect convenience and information. We want to make it easy for them to choose and stay with UH as their healthcare partner. This modern yet simple access breakthrough helps us engage patients on their own terms and their own schedules.”\r\n\r\nTo use the free service, Northeast Ohio patients can visit <a href="https://www.zocdoc.com/hospitals/universityhospitals">UHhospitals.org/schedulenow</a> or download the free ZocDoc <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zocdoc-doctor-appointments/id391062219?mt=8">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zocdoc.android&amp;hl=en">Android</a> app. There, patients can search for providers by insurance and zip code, read professional profiles and verified patient reviews, see doctors’ real-time availability, and make appointments instantly online. At launch, more than 15 different specialties – including primary care physicians in internal medicine, family medicine and pediatrics, as well as OB-GYNS, orthopedists and cardiologists – are bookable via the online service across nearly 100 UH locations.\r\n\r\nPatients can use ZocDoc Check-In to speed the paperwork process too. Their online personal and family medical history forms can be filled out prior to a first appointment and then travel securely with the patient from doctor to doctor – saving time and providing physicians with more complete and accurate patient information.\r\n\r\n“Technology has transformed every aspect of consumers’ lives – setting expectations for immediacy, convenience, ease and information. Finally, technology is changing healthcare too,” said ZocDoc founder and CEO Cyrus Massoumi. “University Hospitals shares our vision of making the patient experience better, and we’re proud to partner with such forward-thinking providers to change the way Cleveland patients access healthcare, essentially over night.”\r\n\r\nNot only does the new UH-ZocDoc partnership make the process of finding a doctor and booking an appointment easier, it also makes it much faster. The typical patient booking via ZocDoc sees a physician within 24 hours – compared to a national average wait time of nearly three weeks. ZocDoc helps uncover the hidden supply of appointments in doctors’ calendars caused by last-minute patient cancellations and reschedules – up to 25 percent of a physician’s day.\r\n\r\nUH is the latest progressive health system to partner with ZocDoc in a string of significant enterprise wins for the digital health company. ZocDoc’s health systems business doubled in 2014 and is on track to double again in 2015.\r\n\r\n<b>About University Hospitals</b>\r\nUniversity Hospitals, the second largest employer in Northeast Ohio with 26,000 employees, serves the needs of patients through an integrated network of 16 hospitals, more than 30 outpatient health centers and primary care physician offices in 15 counties.

While politicos and lobbyists are transfixed by an important yet politicized national debate on healthcare access and systemic structures, 80 percent of Americans admit they are delaying or forgoing preventive care. The issue is worse for Millennials, with nine in 10 (93%) not scheduling doctor visits.\r\n\r\nPreventive care isn’t the only challenge, according to the more than 2,000 Americans surveyed in the ZocDoc study. Nearly a third (31%) report that the difficulty of getting in to see a doctor at the last minute is a reason they don’t make appointments right away when they feel sick. Instead, they are tempted to settle for “Dr. Google.” Forty-three percent of respondents say it would be easier for them to diagnose and treat themselves than to quickly access a doctor if they are feeling unwell.\r\n\r\n"There''s an important healthcare debate happening in Washington, but we''re missing the conversation on Main Street—where patients are struggling to simply find the right doctor and make and keep appointments, amidst family and work obligations,” said ZocDoc founder and president Dr. Oliver Kharraz. "Instead of the empowered consumer that we''re used to, in the role of patient, many Americans are passively engaging with healthcare."\r\n\r\nA breadth of factors stands between patients and care:\r\n<blockquote>• <b>Everyday life trumps healthcare:</b> Overall, health and wellness are a struggle to manage for most Americans (61 percent)—who are less likely to struggle to stay on top of their personal finances, career goals, family obligations, friendships and social life, household responsibilities, beauty routines and even pets’ health. With so many priorities, it’s no wonder nearly 37 percent of people say they have held off booking a checkup because they don’t remember how long it’s been since their last doctor’s visit, or they have forgotten to make an appointment entirely.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>• <b>Work is both a barrier and motivator</b>: Work obligations are a major factor in healthcare decisions, and are the No. 1 reason people of the working world report having to cancel or reschedule a checkup. Nearly half of employed Americans (48%) have canceled an appointment due to work. On the other hand, being sick enough to miss work is the reason that finally motivates one-third (33%) of American workers to book an appointment with the doctor.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>• <b>This call could not be completed as dialed</b>: One in four (24%) Americans say it’s tough to reach a person when they call a doctor’s office and so would rather book online. Calling for an appointment can be so painful and counter-cultural that if patients are not successfully scheduled on the first call, 26 percent wait at least a few weeks to try making an appointment again, if they even attempt to or remember at all. This may be why 80 percent of Americans would be motivated to book a doctor’s appointment online because it is more convenient or they can do it at any time, even when the doctor’s office is closed.</blockquote>\r\n“Our research raises questions about the needs of the modern patient and the state of personal healthcare management in a digital world," said Kharraz. "Our job at ZocDoc is to remove barriers that get in the way of good care, starting with making the doctor-going experience simpler."\r\n\r\nZocDoc’s free service makes the medical appointment-booking process simpler and faster. The typical ZocDoc patient sees a doctor within 24 hours, 18 times faster than the national average wait time. Users can find in-network neighborhood doctors, instantly book appointments online, see what other real patients have to say, get reminders for upcoming appointments and preventive check-ups, fill out their paperwork online, and more.\r\n\r\nZocDoc’s simplified center of care improves healthcare participation for more than just digitally-native Millennials, half (51%) of whom report visiting a doctor less than once per year. For time-strapped women and parents, there is a significant upside to a more seamless digital healthcare experience.\r\n<blockquote>• <b>Women are dropping out more than men:</b> Women are more likely to put off preventive care (82% vs. 78%). And if they are sick, nearly two-thirds of women (66%) would rather wait it out than make a doctor’s appointment right away, compared to just around half of men (52%) in the same situation. Women rely on their instincts and online resources more; nearly half (46%) are more inclined to self-diagnose and self-treat than find a doctor who can see them in short order when feeling unwell, compared to 39 percent of men.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>• <b>Parents are caregivers to everyone but themselves:</b> Parents show a similar rate of delaying or not scheduling checkups as Millennials; 91 percent report not doing it. Once those with kids do get on a doctor’s calendar, they are nearly three times more likely than non-parents to cancel or reschedule their visit. Yet they are quick to send friends and family members to the doctor. More than half (53%) of parents would recommend a same-day appointment for a loved one feeling unwell, but only 30 percent would make the same effort for themselves.</blockquote>\r\nFind more about ZocDoc’s Healthcare Dropout Survey and view the infographic at <a href="http://blog.zocdoc.com/healthcaredropouts">blog.zocdoc.com/healthcaredropouts</a>.\r\n\r\n<b>About the Study</b>\r\nThe ZocDoc Healthcare Dropout Survey was conducted May 13 - 26, 2015 by Kelton Global among 2,183 nationally representative Americans ages 18 and over, using an e-mail invitation and an online survey.

The New York-based company opened its first Phoenix-area office in March of 2013. Today, it employs more than 90 Scottsdale-based employees focused on sales and customer service and plans to expand the local workforce by hundreds to help support its continued, rapid national growth. Earlier this year, ZocDoc announced plans to be live in all 48 contiguous U.S. states by the end of 2014.\r\n\r\n"When we realized we wanted to expand our operations outside of New York City, we did a comprehensive assessment of a wide variety of markets across Mountain and Pacific time zones," said ZocDoc founder and CEO Cyrus Massoumi. "Given its strong universities, direct flights to New York, great weather, incredible talent base, and more, the Phoenix-Scottsdale area came out head-and-shoulders above everything else we considered."\r\n\r\n“I was thrilled when ZocDoc chose to make Scottsdale its first expansion location last year and am even more excited that it has grown so rapidly in the past year that it is already expanding into larger space,” said Scottsdale Mayor W.J. “Jim” Lane. “This is a great testament to our strong local labor pool as well as the premier business environment that Downtown Scottsdale offers.”\r\n\r\nMassoumi founded ZocDoc along with Oliver Kharraz, MD (ZocDoc COO) and Nick Ganju (ZocDoc CTO) nearly seven years ago. The three-person operation, initially run out of an apartment in lower Manhattan, now has more than 600 employees in New York, the Phoenix area and Pune, as well as employees throughout the United States. More than five million patients use ZocDoc’s free service every month and patients have booked more than 1,000 different types of procedures on ZocDoc to date.\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant reasons the company has experienced such rapid growth and adoption is that patients love the free service ZocDoc provides. Not only does ZocDoc help patients more easily find nearby, in-network physicians and instantly book appointments online, the service also makes the process much faster. While the average national wait time to see a doctor is 18.5 days, the typical ZocDoc appointment takes place in less than 24 hours.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, ZocDoc will continue to expand the functionality of its service—seeking to deliver a more seamless healthcare experience for patients and providers alike—by layering new products and features on top of its core online scheduling platform. The company will build upon the success of products like ZocDoc Check-In, which allows patients to fill out paperwork online prior to appointments and then saves the information for future visits with other ZocDoc physicians.\r\n\r\nZocDoc continues to seek great talent to join its Scottsdale-based team, and candidates interested in joining ZocDoc can visit <a href="https://www.zocdoc.com/careers">www.zocdoc.com/careers</a> to explore career opportunities.\r\n\r\n<b>Contacts:</b>\r\nZocDoc: Jessica Aptman, 212.715.8647 or <a href="mailto:jessica.aptman@zocdoc.com">jessica.aptman@zocdoc.com</a>\r\nCity of Scottsdale: Christian Green, 480-312-2612 or <a href="mailto:CGreen@ScottsdaleAZ.gov ">CGreen@ScottsdaleAZ.gov</a>\r\nACA: Joseph Valdez, 602-845-1234 or <a href="mailto:josephv@azcommerce.com">josephv@azcommerce.com</a>\r\n\r\n<b>About ZocDoc</b>\r\nMore than five million patients use ZocDoc each month to find a nearby doctor or dentist, read verified reviews and health content, and instantly book appointments online.

With ZocDoc, patients can find nearby, in-network doctors and instantly book appointments online, helping them avoid the hassle typically associated with securing care, such as waiting on hold, coordinating schedules, wondering whether a doctor takes a particular insurance, or even waiting weeks to see the doctor. ZocDoc not only makes this process easier, it also makes it much faster. While the average wait to see a physician is over 18 days, the majority of appointments booked through ZocDoc occur within just 24 – 72 hours.\r\n\r\n“After noticing the high demand for our service and the superior healthcare practices and institutions in the area, we’re thrilled to now help Tennessee residents easily take control of their health, while helping local physicians improve the efficiency of their practices,” said ZocDoc founder &amp; CEO Cyrus Massoumi. "With medical care, one size doesn’t fit all. ZocDoc strives to be patients’ personal health ally, connecting them with quality physicians who meet their particular needs, when they need them.”\r\n\r\nTo use this free service, patients simply visit the ZocDoc website (<a>www.zocdoc.com</a>) or the free ZocDoc mobile app for <a>iPhone</a> or <a id="com.zocdoc.android&amp;hl=en&quot;"></a>Android and enter their location, insurance, and the type of doctor they would like to see. They can also search by additional criteria such as gender and languages spoken. ZocDoc then shows local physicians’ real-time availability, qualifications, photos, and verified patient reviews to help patients choose the medical provider who best fits their needs. Patients simply select an available appointment time and click to instantly book that appointment. With ZocDoc, patients can book anytime, anywhere – whether the doctor’s office is open or closed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the free online booking service, patients can also use ZocDoc Check-In to fill out their medical registration forms online prior to their visit and save them for future use. This saves patients time in the waiting room, while providing physicians with more complete and accurate patient information. ZocDoc will also send helpful email and text Appointment Reminders and personalized Wellness Reminders to help patients better manage their health.\r\n\r\nDoctors’ schedules have up to a 25 percent last-minute change rate (including cancellations, reschedules, etc.). ZocDoc’s online marketplace reveals this hidden supply of doctor appointments and makes it instantly available online in real time. This transparency not only reduces patients’ long wait times, it also increases efficiency and productivity for local medical practices by optimizing doctors’ schedules and freeing office staff to focus on other patient needs. Such a service is vital given the country’s current doctor shortage, and the recent influx of millions of newly insured patients under the Affordable Care Act.\r\n\r\nToday, patients in Tennessee can use <a>ZocDoc</a> to book appointments with participating primary care doctors; obstetrician-gynecologists; dermatologists; ear, nose, and throat doctors; and dentists.

Today, ZocDoc covers 40 percent of the U.S. population across 2,000 cities and towns, and more than five million patients use the company’s free service each month. With a mission of improving patients’ access to care, ZocDoc is rapidly growing its footprint in order to ensure patients throughout the country can quickly and easily secure in-network appointments with local physicians.\r\n\r\n“Early in ZocDoc’s life, many people said our service would never work outside of New York City,” said ZocDoc founder &amp; CEO Cyrus Massoumi. “We’ve now successfully launched ZocDoc in big cities, suburbs, and rural areas throughout the country, and I’m proud to say that our service works regardless of geography or type of practice. Patients and doctors everywhere have come to rely on our platform, and we’re excited to roll out ZocDoc nationwide over the coming months.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to ZocDoc’s aggressive geographic expansion plans, the company has also broadened its reach by working with the country’s most forward-thinking hospitals and health systems across 20 different states. In 2013 alone, ZocDoc increased its hospital and health system client base by nearly 200 percent, and over the last year ZocDoc began to facilitate enhanced patient access to major health systems such as <a href="http://www.bjc.org/Default.aspx">BJC HealthCare</a>, <a href="http://hhchealth.org/">Hartford HealthCare</a>, <a href="http://www.mainlinehealth.org/">Main Line Health</a>, <a href="http://www.meridianhealth.com/MH/index.cfm">Meridian Health</a>, and <a href="http://www.sentara.com/Pages/Welcome.aspx">Sentara Healthcare</a>. Additionally, ZocDoc has deepened relationships with existing clients including <a href="http://www.adventisthealthpartners.com/">Adventist Health Partners</a>, <a href="https://www.medstarhealth.org/Pages/Home.aspx">MedStar Health</a>, <a href="http://www.mountsinaihealth.org/">Mount Sinai Health System</a>, <a href="http://www.med.nyu.edu/">NYU Langone Medical Center</a>, <a href="http://www.steward.org/">Steward Health Care System</a>, <a href="http://www.tenethealth.com/pages/home.aspx">Tenet Healthcare Corporation</a>, and <a href="http://www.westernconnecticuthealthnetwork.org/">Western Connecticut Health Network</a> among many others. Partnerships with innovative health systems who place a high value on providing an exceptional healthcare experience will continue to be a major lever for ZocDoc’s growth.\r\n\r\n“ZocDoc is a great online marketplace that allows patients to easily make appointments with participating physicians. In the Boston area, where long wait times are common, ZocDoc highlights many Steward physicians that are booking appointments within the same week,” said Michael Callum, MD, President, Steward Medical Group, a division of the <a href="http://www.steward.org/">Steward Health Care System</a>. “We are very pleased to partner with ZocDoc. It is one of the ways that we are making sure that patients have access to primary care physicians without having to wait a long time for an appointment.”\r\n\r\n"We are excited to be partnering with ZocDoc, which gives consumers in our market area rapid, frictionless access to our physicians,” said Eric R. Wagner, Executive Vice President, External Affairs &amp; Diversified Operations for <a href="https://www.medstarhealth.org/Pages/Home.aspx">MedStar Health</a>. “ZocDoc is becoming an integral part of our work to improve access, and our patients love it.”\r\n\r\nAccording to a recent survey by Merritt Hawkins, the national average wait time to see a physician is 18.5 days, and as high as 45 days in cities like Boston. In contrast, the majority of patients who use ZocDoc see a doctor in just 24 – 72 hours. This accelerated access is possible because ZocDoc’s platform reveals the ‘hidden supply’ of care – the 10 to 20 percent of appointments that are cancelled last minute – thereby optimizing doctors’ schedules and offering their availability to patients in real time. At a time when the Affordable Care Act adds millions of patients but no new doctors to the system, ZocDoc’s rapid geographic expansion will help alleviate this supply/demand mismatch of care by making the healthcare marketplace more efficient.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its geographic footprint and enterprise client growth, ZocDoc will continue to expand the functionality of its service by layering new products and features on top of its core scheduling platform. The company will build upon the success of products like ZocDoc Check-In, which allows patients to fill out their paperwork online prior to their appointment and then saves the information for future appointments with other ZocDoc physicians. Today, more than 80 percent of ZocDoc physicians offer this experience to patients. ZocDoc plans to launch even more innovative products in order to continue to deliver a more seamless healthcare experience for patients and doctors alike.\r\n\r\n<b><u>About ZocDoc</u></b>\r\nMore than five million patients use ZocDoc each month to find a nearby doctor or dentist, read verified reviews and health content, and instantly book appointments online.

Additionally, more than two-thirds of ZocDoc physicians accept at least one of these insurance plans. With a mission of improving patients’ access to care, ZocDoc added these plans to its online booking platform to help patients who purchase insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) find and secure the care they expect to receive.\r\n\r\nNearly five million patients each month use ZocDoc.com or the free ZocDoc app to find in-network doctors, read verified reviews, and instantly book appointments online. Not only does ZocDoc’s free service make the appointment booking process much easier, it also makes it much faster despite a growing US doctor shortage. While the average national wait time to see a doctor is nearly three weeks, the majority of ZocDoc appointments take place within 24 - 72 hours. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, there will be a shortage of 125,000 primary care doctors in the United States by 2025. Further compounding this shortage, the ACA will add millions of patients but no new doctors to the healthcare system, potentially creating an even bigger barrier to patient access. A technology solution like ZocDoc not only makes the marketplace for healthcare more efficient by optimizing doctors’ schedules, but it also improves patients’ experience by seamlessly facilitating access to physicians.\r\n\r\n“Patients often delay or avoid securing care because the process can be such a pain, but ZocDoc removes all of the friction from making an appointment,” said ZocDoc founder and CEO Cyrus Massoumi. “In adding these health insurance plans to our platform, ZocDoc is in a position to support new ACA patients as their plans go live and they begin to seek out medical care.”\r\n\r\n“Demand for care is on the rise, and we need to ensure that supply can meet it,” said ZocDoc founder and COO Dr. Oliver Kharraz. “By uncovering the hidden supply of care and connecting patients with doctors who can see them quickly, we make the healthcare ecosystem more efficient and help tackle this growing demand.”\r\n\r\nThe breadth of care available via ZocDoc has grown tremendously since the company’s inception in 2007. Today, patients can use ZocDoc to quickly secure appointments with primary care physicians and internists, as well as with more than 40 different types of specialists. Additionally, patients have booked more than 1,000 different types of procedures on ZocDoc to date – everything from annual physicals to acne treatments, from marriage counseling to migraine consultations and more.\r\n\r\nToday, ZocDoc is available in nearly 2,000 cities and towns, and the service covers 40 percent of the US population.

(280, 2, '2016-01-20 14:57:31', '2016-01-20 14:57:31', '<b>Healthcare providers are embracing online reviews, slowly adopting social media</b>\r\n\r\n<b>NEW YORK, NY – October 10, 2013</b> – <a href="http://zocdoc.com">ZocDoc</a>, a service that helps patients receive faster access to care and optimizes doctors’ schedules, today published the results of its first annual Digital Doctor Survey. This survey will keep a pulse on how physicians engage with various technologies year over year. The 2013 survey explored the use of online reviews, practice management technology, and social media among a sample of ZocDoc’s network of healthcare providers which included primary care doctors, dentists, obstetricians and gynecologists, dermatologists, podiatrists, dietitians, cardiologists, and more.\r\n\r\n<b>Online Reviews</b>\r\n<a href="http://www.reviewtrackers.com/heres-consumers-online-reviews-doctors-hospitals-health-care-services">Research</a> suggests that online reviews may significantly affect patients’ decisions when choosing their healthcare providers, and ZocDoc’s survey results show that the physicians are keenly aware of this. Eighty-five percent of respondents proactively monitor online reviews about themselves, and 36 percent look at their competitors’ reviews. Additionally, ZocDoc asked physicians to rank the fairness of online reviews on a scale of 1-10 and found the following:\r\n\r\n• 23 percent said they’re very fair (rating of 8-10)\r\n• 62 percent said they’re fair (rating of 4-7)\r\n• 15 percent said they’re not fair (rating of 1-3)\r\n\r\n“Patients are eager to access the healthcare system in the same way they engage with their favorite consumer brands, research hotels, or even book restaurants and flights, and it’s important for any physician practicing in today’s day and age to embrace this shift,” said Dr. Keri Peterson, an internal medicine specialist and a ZocDoc client of three years. “As people continue to depend on these reviews to make informed healthcare choices, it will become increasingly important for patients and doctors alike to know which systems close the loop and verify all of these reviews to ensure that they are trustworthy.”\r\n\r\n<b>Practice Management Technology</b>\r\nNew healthcare guidelines make it increasingly important for physicians to leverage technology to keep their practices connected. ZocDoc found that almost 75 percent of physicians surveyed have implemented a practice management system in their office. This is significantly higher than the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2013pres/05/20130522a.html">findings of the US Department of Health and Human Services</a>, which recently reported that roughly half of US physicians have implemented a practice management system.\r\n\r\n“ZocDoc clients tend to quickly adapt to the changing healthcare landscape in this digital world, which likely accounts for the disparity,” said ZocDoc Founder &amp; COO Oliver Kharraz, MD. “These healthcare providers are more aware of how they can utilize ZocDoc and other digital resources to improve their practices. Not only can technology improve office efficiency and enhance online reputations, but most importantly, they can improve patients’ access and care.”\r\n\r\n<b></b><b>Social Media</b>\r\nSocial media platforms are another tool which some physicians are choosing to employ to enhance their digital footprint. Some <a href="http://www.pwc.com/us/en/press-releases/2012/pwc-study-on-social-media-in-healthcare-press-release.jhtml">reports suggest</a> that nearly one-third of patients use social media sites for health-related matters, and that number is growing. This represents a sizable opportunity for physicians to not only promote their practices and connect with patients, but also stay in touch with each other and share educational information.\r\n\r\nZocDoc found that 53 percent of physicians surveyed have a Facebook account for their practice, 34 percent are using Google+, 28 percent are using LinkedIn, and 21 percent are using Twitter. Not surprisingly, overall social media usage is 22 percent higher among physicians between the ages of 26 and 55 than among physicians between 56 and 75 years of age. Thirty percent of practitioners report that they still do not have any social media presence.\r\n\r\n<b><u>About the Survey</u></b>\r\nA sample of ZocDoc healthcare providers received an email in July 2013 inviting them to take the survey. The survey was hosted by a third party vendor and received 360 responses. This annual survey will benchmark trends year over year.\r\n\r\n<b><u>About ZocDoc</u></b>\r\nMore than four million patients use ZocDoc each month to find a nearby doctor or dentist and instantly book an appointment online. By revealing the ''hidden supply'' of appointments, ZocDoc helps patients receive faster access to care and optimizes doctors’ schedules. With ZocDoc Check-In, patients can fill out their paperwork online prior to their appointment, and physicians receive more complete and accurate patient information. ZocDoc has raised $95 million in investments to date, is currently available in more than 1,900 cities, and covers 40 percent of the US population.

This destination provides easy-to-digest information regarding the upcoming Health Insurance Marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act. The goal of this resource is to provide people with independent information and analysis to help them make informed healthcare choices. ZocDoc created this resource to help raise awareness of the new health insurance marketplaces, and better equip individuals to:\r\n\r\n• Learn more about health insurance marketplaces;\r\n• Better understand which plans offer the best access to medical providers with availability;\r\n• Determine which level of coverage might be best for them and their families;\r\n\r\nZocDoc has always worked to improve patients’ access to care and bring efficiency and transparency to the healthcare system, and this new initiative is no exception. Over the course of the company’s nearly six year history, millions of patients have come to view ZocDoc as their personal health ally. As 30 million new patients prepare to enter the system, ZocDoc aims to help them more easily navigate the healthcare space – just as they do for the millions of people who currently use the company’s free service each month.\r\n\r\n“We’re excited to be able to offer this resource to those exploring enrollment in these new health plans,” said ZocDoc founder and COO Oliver Kharraz, MD. “With lots of new information and up to 100 different choices in some marketplaces, navigating this new space may seem daunting. Our aim is to make it easier for the 30 million new patients entering the system to easily access the care they need and deserve.”\r\n\r\nThe key features of the ZocDoc Health Marketplace Resource include:\r\n\r\n• <b>Care Access Grades</b> – Letter grades assigned to each health insurer that indicate how easy it will be for patients to secure near-term appointments with in-network medical providers. Since many plans on the marketplaces will have narrow networks, it is especially important for patients to be able to evaluate the availability of care under each insurer.\r\n• <b>State-specific Information</b> – An overview of what plans are available under each state’s health insurance marketplace.\r\n• <b>FAQs </b>– Answers to common questions, covering a broad array of topics ranging from what a health insurance marketplace is and how it works to how much patients should expect to pay for insurance premiums and more.\r\n• <b>Glossary</b> – Easy-to-understand definitions of common insurance and healthcare industry-related terms, helping patients cut through the jargon and obtain a better practical understanding of the system and its components.\r\n• <b>Health Insurance Giveaway</b> – ZocDoc is giving away health insurance coverage for one individual for one year. To enter for a chance to win, visitors simply need to submit an email address.\r\n\r\nWith the nation’s largest real-time database of available appointments that patients can instantly book online, ZocDoc is in a unique position to provide the most accurate, up-to-date insight into doctor availability and help people evaluate the level of access to care under each health insurance plan in their state’s insurance marketplace. Amid the influx of new information about the insurance system, ZocDoc hopes to lend its expertise to eliminate potential confusion, encourage positive action, and empower more people to obtain the medical care they need. Patients can find the Resource at <a href="http://healthmarketplace.zocdoc.com">healthmarketplace.zocdoc.com</a>.\r\n\r\nZocDoc will allow patients to book with the vast majority of the newly created health insurance plans across the +1,800 cities and towns where the service is currently live. Patients covered under these new insurance plans can begin making appointments with in-network doctors starting in January 2014 on www.zocdoc.com.\r\n\r\n<b><u>About ZocDoc</u></b>\r\nMillions of patients each month use ZocDoc to find a nearby doctor or dentist and instantly book an appointment online.

These types of procedures range from preventive care such as skin screenings, annual physicals, pediatric check-ups, flu shots, genetic counseling, and travel vaccinations, to treatment for more acute issues such as eye emergencies, sports injuries, insect bites, herniated disks, abdominal pain, and more.\r\n\r\n“Looking back to this time five years ago, ZocDoc’s service was only available in New York City and we only facilitated appointments with dentists, primary care physicians, and dermatologists,” said ZocDoc founder &amp; CEO Cyrus Massoumi. “Nearly six years later, we are honored that patients have come to view ZocDoc as their personal health ally, and the fact that they have turned to ZocDoc to seek care for 1,000 different types of procedures – everything from Lasik surgery to a lipids checkup, from mammography to marriage counseling – is a testament to that.”\r\n\r\nToday, patients can use ZocDoc’s free service to instantly book appointments online with 42 different types of specialists ranging from Acupuncturists to Allergists, Nutritionists to Neurologists, Physical Therapists to Psychologists, Radiologists to Rheumatologists, and more. Also, earlier this month, ZocDoc introduced a new feature called Pediatric Search, making it even easier for parents to book appointments with specialists who treat children.\r\n\r\nIt is not just the breadth of ZocDoc’s offering that has grown, but the company’s reach has been on the rise as well. ZocDoc is now live in 35 major markets across the US, and the majority of these markets are profitable. The service is currently available in more than 1,800 cities and towns, covering 40 percent of the US population.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, more than 2.5 million patients use this free service each month, and appointments booked on ZocDoc have increased more than 200 percent year over year. Mobile appointments on ZocDoc have increased by more than 500 percent year over year, and sub-patient bookings (appointments that patients book on behalf of someone else, most typically a child, an elderly parent, or a spouse) on ZocDoc have grown more than 600 percent year over year.\r\n\r\nAs ZocDoc’s service and user base continues to grow, the company’s team grows as well. Given that the company now has more than 400 employees - having doubled in staff size each year for the past three years - ZocDoc has expanded its footprint. In March, ZocDoc opened a new office in the Phoenix, AZ area with a goal of employing more than 650 area residents in the next five years.

To apply, students visit <a href="http://www.zocdoc.com/scholarship">www.zocdoc.com/scholarship</a> and submit a one- to two-page essay discussing a personal health experience, how it relates to the healthcare system as a whole, and any changes they would make to the healthcare system as a result.

Complementing ZocDoc’s existing service which helps patients <a>find nearby doctors</a> and instantly book appointments online, ZocDoc Check-In allows patients to fill out medical forms online, at their convenience, prior to their visit. ZocDoc securely saves this information and will pre-fill forms when a patient books with a participating ZocDoc physician in the future. The patient simply needs to verify the information on future forms, fill out any new specialty fields, and check-in online again with the click of a button.\r\n\r\nZocDoc Check-In is free for patients, and comes at no additional cost to medical providers using ZocDoc’s service. As of today, 10 percent of ZocDoc patients will have access to the ZocDoc Check-In experience, and over the coming weeks, more medical practices will adopt the ZocDoc Check-In feature. In early testing, doctors and office staff praised the improved accuracy, efficiency, legibility, and streamlined workflow that ZocDoc Check-In provides. The opportunity to fill out their paperwork in advance has been the #1 most requested feature to date by patients using <a>ZocDoc</a>, and early testing with patients has also been overwhelmingly positive.\r\n\r\n“We hope that ZocDoc Check-In marks the end of the clipboard and further empowers patients to get the care they need," said ZocDoc founder and CEO <a>Cyrus Massoumi</a>. “Improving patients’ experience and offering more convenient ways to see a doctor are just a few of the ways we will strive to transform healthcare in the coming months and years.”\r\n\r\nZocDoc Check-In provides the following benefits to patients and doctors:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b>Convenience</b>– Patients can fill out the forms online, in advance, and on their own time. Doctors receive the forms ahead of the patient’s visit, allowing them to speed up in-office workflow.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Accuracy</b>– Patients can take their time filling out paperwork, leading to increased accuracy. Digital formats encourage more complete information and are more legible for office staff.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Speed</b>– In booking future appointments with ZocDoc doctors, patients will see pre-populated Check-In forms, saving time and preventing duplicative efforts. Patients also no longer need to arrive at their appointment early to allow extra time for waiting room paperwork.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTo use ZocDoc Check-In, patients first book an appointment with a participating ZocDoc provider. When prompted to check-in online, they simply enter the information that the practice requires, which can include insurance information, medical history, reason for visit, and more. Once a patient has checked in online, the practice can choose to print that patient’s intake forms prior to the visit or display them digitally, depending on that office’s preferred workflow.\r\n\r\nZocDoc currently offers appointments with healthcare providers in 31 major metropolitan areas across the US, including Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Ft.

Among applicable 18 – 34 year olds:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b>79 percent</b> said that they can evaluate a new gadget easier that they can a new doctor or dentist;</li>\r\n	<li><b>76 percent</b> said it is easier to find information to help them find a hotel that fits their needs than to help them find a doctor or dentist that fits their needs;</li>\r\n	<li><b>64 percent</b> feel that when choosing a new doctor or dentist, they do not know how to adequately evaluate whether or they fit their specific needs, so it came as no surprise to learn that...</li>\r\n	<li><b>79 percent</b> admitted to picking a doctor or dentist primarily based on whether or not they accept their insurance.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"This study highlights the need for the healthcare space to play technological catch up to other industries," said Dr. Roshini Rajapaksa, Assistant Professor of Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center. "If we are not technologically savvy enough to make healthcare user friendly for our young population, then this generation will be less likely to regularly seek out the preventive care they need and deserve. As a physician, that''s incredibly concerning."\r\n<b></b><b>Long Wait Times For Doctor Appointments Discouraging Younger Patients</b>\r\n82% of applicable 18-34 year old adults also said that having to wait weeks to get in to see a doctor or dentist is ''unacceptable,'' yet this long wait time is unfortunately becoming the norm throughout the country. The average <a href="http://www.merritthawkins.com/pdf/mha2009waittimesurvey.pdf">wait time to see a doctor</a> in most cities is approximately three weeks with some cities'' wait times averaging up to 70 days. While the country is already experiencing a doctor shortage which is contributing to these long wait times, this problem is poised to become even worse as proposed healthcare reforms stand to introduce 32 million new patients into an already congested system.\r\n\r\n"This study highlights that Generation Y is feeling powerless and frustrated by the current state of healthcare," said ZocDoc COO &amp; Founder Dr. Oliver Kharraz. "As these young, connected patients solidify the health behaviors they''ll practice throughout their lives, it''s more important than ever to equip and empower them to take control of their own health by offering them more digital and mobile tools, services and information. By finding a way to bridge the gap between Generation Y''s expectations and healthcare''s inefficiencies, we can help alleviate some of this generation''s pain points as we enter into a new era of healthcare."\r\n\r\n<b>Survey Methodology</b>\r\nThis survey was conducted online within the United States between April 19th and April 23rd, 2012 among 2,211 adults (aged 18 and over).

By allowing patients to find a doctor, sort by location and insurance plan, and schedule appointments online at ZocDoc.com, the service eliminates time-consuming phone calls so that patients can book anytime – even when the doctor’s office is closed. Patients are shown a variety of tools to help choose the best medical provider for their needs, including each doctor’s qualifications, languages spoken, professional statement, and reviews. ZocDoc also offers a free app for iPhone, Android, and BlackBerry, allowing patients to find doctors and make appointments on the go. ZocDoc has raised more than $95 million in funding to date from the leading names in technology and finance, including Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com.\r\n\r\nCyrus Massoumi, ZocDoc co-founder and CEO, developed the idea for ZocDoc while on a flight from Seattle to New York in 2007. He burst his eardrum during the flight, and upon landing in New York he was unable to find a doctor who could see him for four days. “My painful experience made me realize that while technology has brought us instant access to books, flights, and music, nothing is more important than medical care when you need it. No service existed that could deliver instant access to a doctor,” said Massoumi. “It feels great to simplify the healthcare system for Seattle residents, and bring our service to the very place where the idea for ZocDoc was born.”\r\n\r\nSeattle-area residents wait more than two weeks on average for medical appointments, according to a study by healthcare search and consulting firm Merritt Hawkins. ZocDoc’s unique system reveals a hidden supply of doctor availability, including appointments cancelled last-minute by patients, and makes it instantly accessible online. The system thus reduces wait times for patients and increases efficiency for medical providers – a vital service given the country’s current doctor shortage. Forty percent of all appointments scheduled by ZocDoc users occur within one day, and 60 percent of ZocDoc appointments take place within three days.\r\n\r\nAs of today, primary care physicians, obstetrician-gynecologists, and dermatologists are offering more than 50,000 appointments across <a href="HTTP://WWW.ZOCDOC.COM/PRIMARY-CARE-DOCTORS/SEATTLE-219852PM">Seattle</a>, <a href="HTTP://WWW.ZOCDOC.COM/PRIMARY-CARE-DOCTORS/BELLEVUE-220256PM">Bellevue</a>, <a href="HTTP://WWW.ZOCDOC.COM/PRIMARY-CARE-DOCTORS/TACOMA-219931PM">Tacoma</a>, and the surrounding areas. Additional doctors, specialties, and appointment times will be added in the coming months.\r\n\r\nTo use the service, patients visit the ZocDoc website (<a href="HTTP://WWW.ZOCDOC.COM/">www.zocdoc.com</a>) or use one of the free ZocDoc apps to enter their location, insurance plan, and the type of healthcare provider they would like to see. ZocDoc then shows each doctor’s schedule in real-time, along with credentials and patient reviews, in order to help patients choose the practitioner who best fits their needs. Patients simply select a timeslot and complete a brief checkout process to book an appointment. ZocDoc then sends email and text message reminders to help patients remember to attend their doctor visits.\r\n\r\nThe Seattle region is the 14th area to receive ZocDoc service, and the city was chosen due to high demand in the area for ZocDoc.

ZocDoc is the first consumer healthcare investment for Khosla Ventures.\r\nZocDoc uses the Internet to help improve patient access to healthcare. Patients can see real-time availability of doctors in their area, find those that accept their insurance plan and read feedback from real patients. Most importantly, patients can book an appointment - including same-day and next-day appointments - instantly online.\r\n\r\n"ZocDoc is addressing a real need in healthcare," said Vinod Khosla, founder of Khosla Ventures. "The Internet has the potential to fundamentally improve access to care, and the company has gained initial traction towards this long-term vision."\r\nAs part of this round, David Weiden, partner at Khosla Ventures, will join ZocDoc''s co-founders Cyrus Massoumi and Oliver Kharraz on the company''s Board of Directors. ZocDoc will use the funding to expand its network of practitioners and lay the groundwork for a nationwide rollout.\r\n\r\n"Our goal is to make healthcare simple and more accessible to patients so they can get the care they need, when they need it," said Cyrus Massoumi, ZocDoc cofounder and CEO. "We are thrilled to have the support of Khosla Ventures, whose experience building highly successful companies and commitment to improving society and the way we live through technology is unparalleled."\r\nBased in Manhattan, ZocDoc is currently available in New York City, but that hasn''t stopped the company from gaining national attention since launching at TechCrunch 40 last September. In the last three weeks alone, ZocDoc was named one of PC Magazine''s "Top Web Sites of 2008," a semi-finalist in Forbes.com''s "Boost Your Business" competition, and a finalist in The Industry Standard''s "Innovation 100 Awards."\r\n\r\n<b>About ZocDoc, Inc.</b>\r\nZocDoc''s mission is to use the Web to make healthcare simple. For patients, ZocDoc is an online service that helps them find and book doctor and dentist appointments instantly, 24/7.

(410, 2, '2016-01-21 15:05:24', '2016-01-21 15:05:24', '<b>New York-based company named one of the 40 hottest startups globally.</b>\r\n\r\n<b>SAN FRANCISCO - September 18, 2007</b> - ZocDoc, a new company that provides an online channel for consumers to find and book doctor and dentist appointments instantly, launched today at TechCrunch40, where they were named one of the 40 hottest startups globally. ZocDoc is like OpenTable, which uses the Internet to enable consumers to make reservations at their favorite restaurants very quickly, often taking advantage of last minute openings. ZocDoc applies the power of the Internet to improve a system that, until now, was frustrating for patients, inefficient for physicians, and far too complex and lengthy for everyone.\r\n\r\n"We started ZocDoc to improve the patient healthcare experience, because, let''s be honest, it is a pain and frustration that everyone has felt more than once," said Cyrus Massoumi, CEO and co-founder of ZocDoc. "The goal is to make patients aware of open appointments for local doctors in real time, anytime, and book those times 24/7 and even minutes before the appointment. Our simple solution addresses a very complex problem that until now had not been solved."\r\n\r\n<b>ZocDoc Patient Features</b>\r\nZocDoc''s website is fast and easy-to-use and eliminates previous frustrations such as being put on hold or waiting weeks for an appointment. Additionally, ZocDoc features insurance validation to ensure the doctor of your choice is covered. ZocDoc also puts consumers back in the driver''s seat when making healthcare decisions by providing them with detailed background information on all participating physicians and dentists. This includes feedback from previous patients, in a reviews feature similar to those from services like eBay and Yelp. These reviews are unique because only real patients can leave feedback, and only after an appointment has taken place. Other features include integrated Google Maps and an appointment availability auto-notification via e-mail. The service is available to consumers immediately.\r\n\r\n<b>ZocDoc Doctor Benefits</b>\r\nParticipating physicians and dentists benefit greatly from the ZocDoc service as well. ZocDoc helps healthcare practitioners grow their practice by giving them wider visibility on the web, as well as attracting new patients, particularly for those practitioners with strong patient reviews and feedback. In addition, ZocDoc improves the efficiency of a medical business, helping alleviate productivity lost from last minute cancellations by filling those times with other patients. Even the best doctors have a handful of cancellations every day that may be lost and wasted, and by helping fill those times, ZocDoc creates capacity in an overextended healthcare system.\r\n\r\n<b>ZocDoc Market Potential and Availability</b>\r\nZocDoc is free to consumers. In this early-launch stage, ZocDoc is also free to medical practitioners. However, the ongoing business model calls for a nominal service fee to be charged to participating practitioners, as well as the addition of targeted advertising.\r\n\r\nEven with a nominal service fee, ZocDoc has a large, and lucrative, market around it, sized at a market potential of $15-30 billion nationally. There are 720,000 private practice healthcare practitioners in the United States, with an average of more than 3,000 appointments each year.\r\n\r\nZocDoc''s service is currently restricted to dental appointments in the New York City area. Over 2 percent of the dentists in Manhattan have already signed up to use the service while still in pre-launch testing. And ZocDoc is managing a long and growing waiting list of doctors and other dentists, over 100 practitioners in total, eager make their appointments available on ZocDoc. The company is onboarding new practitioners on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nOther cities and specialties will be added soon. ZocDoc is committed to putting its expansion plans in the hands of its users, giving them the opportunity to vote online for where ZocDoc goes next. Consumers can visit <a href="https://www.zocdoc.com/ZocDoc">ZocDoc</a> to enter their requests. For those residing in or visiting Manhattan, dentist listings are available, live, starting today.\r\n\r\n<b>About ZocDoc</b>\r\nZocDoc is a NYC-based start-up founded in April 2007 by serial entrepreneurs Cyrus Massoumi and Oliver Kharraz, MD, who combine to bring 9 years healthcare technology experience from McKinsey, as well as extensive entrepreneurial experience.

We will not be liable for cancelled or otherwise unfulfilled appointments, or any injury resulting therefrom, or for any other injury resulting or arising from or related to the use of the Site or Services whatsoever.\r\n\r\nYou are strongly advised to perform your own investigation prior to selecting a Healthcare Provider by making confirming telephone calls to the appropriate licensing or certification authorities to verify listed credentials and education, and to further verify information about a particular Healthcare Provider by confirming with the Healthcare Provider''s office, your current Healthcare Providers, the medical association(s) relevant to the Healthcare Provider''s specialty and your state medical board(s).\r\n\r\n<b>4. AUTHORIZATION AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT; IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTHCARE PROVIDER RELATIONSHIPS AND LISTS</b>\r\n\r\nIn connection with using the Site and the Services to locate and schedule appointments with Healthcare Providers, you understand that:\r\n\r\nYOU ARE ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR CHOOSING YOUR OWN HEALTHCARE PROVIDER.\r\n\r\nZocDoc uses reasonable efforts to ensure that Healthcare Providers only participate in the Services if they hold all active licenses required by law to practice the specialties of the services offered by them, and are not excluded from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. ZocDoc may exclude Healthcare Providers who, in ZocDoc''s discretion, have engaged in inappropriate or unprofessional conduct.\r\n\r\nHealthcare Providers listed through the Services with whom you may book appointments enter into contracts with us, and may pay us a fee in order to be marketed through the Services. We will provide you with lists and/or profile previews of Healthcare Providers who may be suitable to provide the healthcare services you seek based on information that you provide to us (such as insurance information, geographical location, and healthcare specialty). In an effort to aid in the discovery of Healthcare Providers and enable the maximum choice and diversity of Healthcare Providers participating in the Services, these lists and/or profile previews may also be based on other criteria (including, for example, Healthcare Provider availability, past selections by and/or ratings of Healthcare Providers by you or by other ZocDoc users, and past experience of ZocDoc users with Healthcare Providers); but ZocDoc (a) does not recommend or endorse any Healthcare Providers, (b) does not make any representations or warranties with respect to these Healthcare Providers or the quality of the healthcare services they may provide, and (c) does not receive any additional fees from Healthcare Providers for featuring them (i.e., higher or better placement on lists) through the Services (subject to the Sponsored Results as described below). Note, however, to the extent that you use the Services as provided by your employer, ZocDoc may provide lists and/or profile previews based also on criteria determined by your employer and your employer''s agents or advisors.\r\n\r\nWe may show you sponsored results on the Site, including at the top of search results ("Sponsored Results").

("us," "we," or "<b>ZocDoc</b>") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of our customers, visitors, and other users of ZocDoc.com (the "<b>Site</b>") and related websites, applications, services and mobile applications provided by ZocDoc and on/in which this Privacy Policy is posted or referenced (collectively, the "<b>Services</b>"). We created this Privacy Policy ("<b>Privacy Policy</b>") to give you confidence as you use the Services and to demonstrate our commitment to the protection of privacy. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other website or digital service that you may be able to access through the Services or any website or digital services of ZocDoc''s business partners, each of which may have data collection, storage and use practices and policies that may materially differ from this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Services is governed by this Privacy Policy and the Agreement (as the term "Agreement" is defined in our <a href="https://www.zocdoc.com/terms/updated">Terms of Use</a>). Any capitalized term used but not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning in the Agreement.\r\n\r\nBY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE PRACTICES AND POLICIES OUTLINED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION, USE, AND SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU CANNOT USE THE SERVICES.

Information We Collect</b>\r\n\r\n<b>2.1 </b><b>Personal Information</b>\r\n\r\n<b>2.1.1 </b><b>Personal Information Generally</b>\r\n\r\nSome of the Services require us to know more about you so that we can best meet your needs. When you access these Services, we may ask you to voluntarily provide us certain information that personally identifies (or could be used to personally identify) you ("<b>Personal Information</b>"). Personal Information includes (but is not limited to) the following categories of information: (1) contact data (such as your e-mail address and phone number); (2) demographic data (such as your gender, your date of birth and your zip code); (3) insurance data (such as your insurance carrier, insurance plan, member ID, group ID and payer ID); (4) medical data (such as the doctors, dentists or other health care providers ("<b>Healthcare Providers</b>") you have visited, your reasons for visit, your dates of visit, your medical history, and other medical and health information you choose to share with us), and (5) other information that you voluntarily choose to provide to us, including without limitation SSN, unique identifiers such as passwords, and Personal Information in emails or letters that you send to us. You may still access and use some of the Services if you choose not to provide us with any Personal Information, but the features of the Services that require your Personal Information will not be accessible to you.\r\n\r\n<b>2.1.2 </b><b>Billing, Collection and Payment Information</b>\r\n\r\nWhen you make a payment through our Services to a Healthcare Provider (as further described in and subject to other provisions of the Agreement), your payment card information is processed by our payment processing partner, Stripe (<a href="https://stripe.com/">https://stripe.com</a>). Stripe collects your voluntarily provided payment card information necessary to process your payment. Stripe''s use and storage of information it collects is governed by Stripe''s applicable terms of service and privacy policy. The information we store includes your payment card type and the last four digits of the payment card. We may provide to you the option to remove your stored payment card information through your account settings page.\r\n\r\n<b>2.2 </b><b>Traffic Data</b>\r\n\r\nWe also may automatically collect certain data when you use the Services, such as (1) IP address; (2) domain server; (3) type of device(s) used to access the Services; (4) web browser(s) used to access the Services; (5) referring webpage or other source through which you accessed the Services; (6) geolocation information; and (7) other statistics and information associated with the interaction between your browser or device and the Services (collectively "<b>Traffic Data</b>"). Depending on applicable law, some Traffic Data may be Personal Information.\r\n\r\nWe may also collect additional information, which may be Personal Information, as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.\r\n\r\n<b>2.3 </b><b>HIPAA and PHI</b>\r\n\r\nUnder a federal law called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("<b>HIPAA</b>"), some of the demographic, health and/or health-related information that ZocDoc collects as part of providing the Services may be considered "protected health information" or "<b>PHI</b>". Specifically, when ZocDoc receives identifiable information about you from or on behalf of your Healthcare Providers, this information is PHI. HIPAA provides specific protections for the privacy and security of PHI and restricts how PHI is used and disclosed. ZocDoc may only use and disclose your PHI in the ways permitted by your Healthcare Provider(s). In addition, you have been or will be asked to e-sign the ZocDoc User Authorization (the "<b>ZocDoc Authorization</b>"). Your decision to e-sign the ZocDoc Authorization is entirely voluntary. If you choose to e-sign the ZocDoc Authorization, you agree that ZocDoc may use and disclose your PHI in the same way it uses and discloses your Personal Information that is not PHI. These uses and disclosures are described in this Privacy Policy. To the extent any provision in the ZocDoc Authorization is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or other provisions of the Agreement, then the provision in the ZocDoc Authorization only controls with respect to your PHI. If you do not e-sign the ZocDoc Authorization, then your Personal Information that is not PHI is governed by this Privacy Policy and your Personal Information that is PHI is used and disclosed only as permitted by your Healthcare Provider(s).\r\n\r\n<b>3. How We Collect Information</b>\r\n\r\nWe collect information (including Personal Information and Traffic Data) when you use and interact with the Services, and in some cases from third party sources. Such information includes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>When you use the Services'' interactive tools and services, such as searching for Healthcare Providers, searching for available appointments with Healthcare Providers and completing medical history forms ("<b>Medical History Forms</b>") prior to Healthcare Provider appointments;</li>\r\n	<li>When you voluntarily provide information in free-form text boxes through the Services and through responses to surveys, questionnaires and the like;</li>\r\n	<li>If you download and install certain applications and software we make available, we may receive and collect information transmitted from your computing device for the purpose of providing you the relevant Services, such as information that lets ZocDoc know when you are logged on and available to receive update or alert notices;</li>\r\n	<li>If you download our mobile application, we may receive information about your location and mobile device;</li>\r\n	<li>Through cookies, web beacons, website analytics services and other tracking technology (collectively, "<b>Tracking Tools</b>"), as described below; and</li>\r\n	<li>When you use the "Contact Us" function on the Site, send us an email or otherwise contact us.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b>4. Tracking Tools and "Do Not Track"</b>\r\n\r\n<b>4.1. </b><b>Tracking Tools</b>\r\n\r\nWe may use tools outlined below in order to better understand users.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b></b><b>Cookies:</b> "Cookies" are small computer files transferred to your computing device that contain information such as user ID, user preferences, lists of pages visited and activities conducted while using the Services. We use Cookies to help us improve or tailor the Services by tracking your navigation habits, storing your authentication status so you do not have to re-enter your credentials each time you use the Services, customizing your experience with the Services and for analytics and fraud prevention.</li>\r\n	<li></li>\r\n	<li>We may use a type of advertising commonly known as interest-based or online behavioral advertising. This means that some of our business partners use Cookies to display ZocDoc ads on other websites and services based on information about your use of the Services and on your interests (as inferred from your online activity). Other Cookies used by our business partners may collect information when you use the Services, such as the IP address, mobile device ID, operating system, browser, web page interactions, the geographic location of your internet service provider and demographic information, such as gender and age range. These Cookies help ZocDoc learn more about our users'' demographics and internet behaviors.</li>\r\n	<li></li>\r\n	<li>For more information on cookies, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><b></b><b>Web Beacons:</b> "Web Beacons" (a.k.a. clear GIFs or pixel tags) are tiny graphic image files imbedded in a web page or email that may be used to collect anonymous information about your use of our Services, the websites of selected advertisers and the emails, special promotions or newsletters that we send you. The information collected by Web Beacons allows us to analyze how many people are using the Services, using the selected advertisers'' websites or opening our emails, and for what purpose, and also allows us to enhance our interest-based advertising.</li>\r\n	<li><b></b><b>Website Analytics:</b> We may use third-party website analytics services in connection with the Services, including, for example, to register mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity and text that you type into the Site. These website analytics services generally do not collect Personal Information unless you voluntarily provide it and generally do not track your browsing habits across websites which do not use their services. We use the information collected from these services to help make the Services easier to use and as otherwise set forth in Section 6 (Use of Information).</li>\r\n	<li><b></b><b>Mobile Device Identifiers:</b> Mobile device identifiers are data stored on your mobile device that may track mobile device and data and activities occurring on and through it, as well as the applications installed on it. Mobile device identifiers enable collection of Personal Information (such as media access control, address and location) and Traffic Data. As with other Tracking Tools, mobile device identifiers help ZocDoc learn more about our users'' demographics and internet behaviors.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b>4.2. </b><b>Options for Opting out of Cookies and Mobile Device Identifiers</b>\r\n\r\nSome web browsers (including some mobile web browsers) allow you to reject Cookies or to alert you when a Cookie is placed on your computer, tablet or mobile device. You may be able to reject mobile device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device. Although you are not required to accept ZocDoc''s Cookies or mobile device identifiers, if you block or reject them, you may not have access to all features available through the Services.\r\n\r\nYou may opt out of receiving certain Cookies and certain trackers by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">opt out page</a> or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed">consumer opt-out page</a>. When you use these opt-out features, an "opt-out" Cookie will be placed on your computer or tablet indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertising from NAI or DAA member companies. If you delete Cookies on your computer or tablet, you may need to opt out again. For information about how to opt out of interest-based advertising on mobile device identifiers, please visit <a href="http://www.applicationprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertising-choices-on-a-mobile-device">http://www.applicationprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertising-choices-on-a-mobile-device</a>. Please note that even after opting out of interest-based advertising, you may still see ZocDoc''s advertisements that are not interest-based (i.e., not targeted toward you). Also, opting out does not mean that ZocDoc is no longer using Tracking Tools -- ZocDoc still may collect information about your use of the Services even after you have opted out of interest-based advertisements and may still serve advertisements to you via the Services based on information it collects via the Services.\r\n\r\n<b>4.3. </b><b>How ZocDoc Responds to Browser "Do Not Track" Signals</b>\r\n\r\nSome web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a "Do Not Track" (DNT) or similar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website operator elects to respond to a particular DNT signal, the website operator may refrain from collecting certain Personal Information about the browser''s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For these reasons, many website operators, including ZocDoc, do not take action to respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, visit <a href="http://allaboutdnt.com/">http://allaboutdnt.com</a>.\r\n\r\n<b>5. Use of Information</b>\r\n\r\nWe use your information, including Personal Information, to provide the Services to you and to help improve them, including to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>provide you with the products, services and information you request and respond to correspondence that we receive from you;</li>\r\n	<li>provide, maintain, administer or expand the Services, perform business analyses, or for other internal purposes to support, improve or enhance our business, the Services, and other products and services we offer;</li>\r\n	<li>notify you about certain resources or Healthcare Providers we think you may be interested in learning more about;</li>\r\n	<li>send you information about ZocDoc or our products or Services;</li>\r\n	<li>contact you when necessary or requested, including to remind you of an upcoming appointment;</li>\r\n	<li>customize and tailor your experience of the Services, which may include sending customized messages or showing you Sponsored Results that may be of interest to you based on information collected in accordance with this Privacy Policy;</li>\r\n	<li>send emails and other communications that display content that we think will interest you and according to your preferences;</li>\r\n	<li>combine information received from third parties with the information that we have from or about you and use the combined information for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy;</li>\r\n	<li>use statistical information that we collect in any way permitted by law, including from third parties in connection with their commercial and marketing efforts; and</li>\r\n	<li>prevent, detect and investigate security breaches and potentially illegal or prohibited activities.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe may use information that is neither Personal Information nor PHI (including non-PHI Personal Information that has been de-identified and/or aggregated) to better understand who uses ZocDoc and how we can deliver a better healthcare experience (for example, testing different kinds of emails has helped us understand when and how patients prefer to get Wellness Reminders for preventive care), or otherwise at our discretion.\r\n\r\n<b>6. Disclosure of Information</b>\r\n\r\nWe may disclose certain information that we collect from you:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>We may share your Personal Information with Healthcare Providers with which you choose to schedule through the Services. For example, if you complete a Medical History Form using the Services in advance of an appointment, we may share your Medical History Form with your Healthcare Providers. You also may choose to store but not share your Medical History Form.</li>\r\n	<li>We may share your Personal Information with your Healthcare Providers to enable them to refer you to and make appointments with other Healthcare Providers on your behalf or to perform analyses on potential health issues or treatments, provided that you choose to use the applicable Services.</li>\r\n	<li>We may share your Personal Information with Healthcare Providers in the event of an emergency.</li>\r\n	<li>We may also share your Personal Information with organizations that collect, aggregate and organize your information so they can make it more easily accessible to your Healthcare Providers.</li>\r\n	<li>We do not sell email addresses to third parties. We may share your email address with our business partners to enable them to help ZocDoc customize our advertising.</li>\r\n	<li>We may share your Personal Information and Traffic Data with our business partners who perform core operational services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, data storage, security, insurance verification, or Website analytics set forth in Section 4.1 (Tracking Tools)) and/or by making certain features available to our users.</li>\r\n	<li>For the purposes of determining eligibility and cost-sharing obligations, and otherwise obtaining benefit plan information, we may share with the insurance provider you identify to us (via our business partners) your insurance-related Personal Information.</li>\r\n	<li>We may transfer your information to another company in connection with a merger, sale, acquisition or other change of ownership or control by or of ZocDoc (whether in whole or in part). Should one of these events occur, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you before your information becomes subject to different privacy and security policies and practices.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also may need to disclose your Personal Information or any other information we collect about you if we determine in good faith that such disclosure is needed to: (1) comply with applicable law, regulation, court order or other legal process; (2) protect the rights, property or safety of ZocDoc or another party; (3) enforce the Agreement or other agreements with you; or (4) respond to claims that any posting or other content violates third-party rights.\r\n\r\nWe may disclose information that is neither Personal Information nor PHI (including non-PHI Personal Information that has been de-identified and/or aggregated) at our discretion.\r\n\r\nWe store and process your information on our servers in the United States and abroad. We maintain industry standard backup and archival systems.\r\n\r\n<b>7. Public Information</b>\r\n\r\nAny information that you may reveal in a review posting or online discussion or forum is intentionally open to the public and is not in any way private. We recommend that you carefully consider whether to disclose any Personal Information in any public posting or forum. What you have written may be seen and/or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict.\r\n\r\n<b>8.

In connection with such payments, we process your payment card information in accordance with our <a href="https://www.zocdoc.com/privacypolicy/updated">Privacy Policy</a>.

Healthcare Providers are required to provide the applicable Designated Provider Service at or below the price indicated at the time of scheduling ("Designated Price"), unless you separately agree otherwise. Services in addition to or different from Designated Provider Services may be available, offered or rendered by Healthcare Providers. You and your Healthcare Providers are responsible for agreeing to any additional or different services.

Please also keep in mind that (a) the Insurance Content is constantly being updated (for example, to reflect amounts you may have paid earlier towards your deductible), (b) you are likely to receive an explanation of benefits (or similar document) from you insurance company after you receive your Healthcare Provider''s services, and (c) you may owe your Healthcare Provider more than the amount you paid through the Insurance Payment Services.\r\n\r\n<b>1.4. Transaction Processing.</b>\r\n\r\nThe transaction processing fee for the Transaction Processing Services reflects the fair market value for the Transaction Processing Services provided by ZocDoc and its payment processing partner. Healthcare Providers may separately charge you for additional or different products or services.\r\n\r\nYou acknowledge and agree that:\r\n\r\n(a) you are responsible for and you will pay the Designated Price for the Designated Provider Services charged through ZocDoc by the applicable Healthcare Provider, as well as other amounts the applicable Healthcare Provider may charge through ZocDoc for any additional or different services rendered during or related to the applicable appointment;\r\n\r\n(b) you remain responsible for paying all amounts required by law and/or contract (e.g., health plan agreement), including all cost-sharing obligations (such as, but not limited to, copayments, deductibles and other coinsurance obligations);\r\n\r\n(c) ZocDoc may process your payment, and may do so in collaboration with our payment processing partner;\r\n\r\n(d) ZocDoc is not responsible for any charges incurred for any products or services provided by Healthcare Provider, including any Designated Provider Service;\r\n\r\n(e) ZocDoc is not responsible for any charges submitted for processing by Healthcare Providers;\r\n\r\n(f) in the event you dispute any fees chargeable or charged through ZocDoc by a Healthcare Provider, you will resolve such dispute directly with the applicable Healthcare Provider;\r\n\r\n(g) by using the Transaction Processing Services, you accept the terms of use and privacy policy of our payment processing partner with respect to Transaction Processing Services; and\r\n\r\n(h) you will promptly review all charges processed through the Transaction Processing Services, and immediately notify ZocDoc to the extent you have any questions, concerns or disputes; in no event may you raise any questions, concerns or disputes after twelve (12) months from the date of the applicable transaction; and\r\n\r\nYou further acknowledge and agree that: neither ZocDoc nor our payment processing partner will be responsible if either we or our payment processing partner are unable to complete a transaction for any reason, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n(A) if you have not provided us with accurate, current and complete payment information;\r\n\r\n(B) if you do not have sufficient available funds or available credit to complete the transaction;\r\n\r\n(C) if you do not have an active payment card, or if we are unable to confirm your payment card information or your identity;\r\n\r\n(D) if your account with us, your account with our payment processing partner, your access to the Services, or your access to our payment processing partner''s services has been terminated or suspended for any reason;\r\n\r\n(E) if we or our payment processing partner have reason to believe that the requested transaction is unauthorized; or\r\n\r\n(F) if we terminate or suspend the services we provide to the applicable Healthcare Provider.\r\n\r\n<b>2.
